As such, while all rules in this book are optional  and secondary to the Game Master\u2019s discretion, this section is especially so. A Non-Player Character\u2019s (NPC\u2019s) attitude  and relationship toward the Player-Characters (PCs) is best handled narratively and intuitively. However, this section  provides optional rules and structure to help support the GM in managing a given NPC\u2019s relationship and attitude toward a  given PC.  NPC Relationship Table    Temperament (Reduced with [Intimidate] or degrees of Fear)  Skittish  Wary  Calculating  Aggressive  Vicious  Disposition (Improved with [Charm])  Loyal  Devotee  Supporter  Ally  Adherent  Fanatical  Follower  Friendly  Admirer  Proponent  Comrade /  Associate  Friend  Unwavering  Friend  Warm  Curious  Observer  Sympathizer  Fellow  Citizen  Advocate  Keeper  Indifferent  Anxious,  Evasive  Stranger  Curt,  Defensive  Stranger  Indifferent  Stranger  Assertive  Stranger  Aggressive  Stranger  Cold  Skeptic  Doubter  Competitor  Critic  Slanderer  Hostile  Dissident  Underminer  Opponent  Rival  Foe  Loathing  Spiteful  Victim  Saboteur  Adversary  Enemy  Nemesis    Most NPCs will likely fall under \u201cIndifferent Stranger\u201d. Disposition may vary or change based on how well the player\u2019s  goals and values align with those of the NPC. Temperament is largely determined by the personality of the NPC but can be  changed with the level of Fear imposed on them.  A [Charm] check with the purpose of increasing a character's Disposition can be attempted once per target per Short Rest.  Disposition can only increase by one step once per Long Rest. The difficulty of the [Charm] check depends on their current  Disposition and alignment of values.  Disposition  Difficulty to Increase*  Loyal  --  Friendly  [Charm 10]  Warm  [Charm 8]  Indifferent  [Charm 6]  Cold  [Charm 8]  Hostile  [Charm 10]  Loathing  [Charm 12]    Temperament  [Charm] Check Modifier  Target is Skittish  -2D  Target is Wary  -1D  Target is Calculating  --  Target is Aggressive  -1D  Target is Vicious  -2D  *An alternative rule is to use [Charm] vs target\u2019s  [Composure].

Hostile or potentially hostile characters (\u201cseekers\u201d) have  a Passive Detection Range of 30 ft. A sneaking character  may move within this range without being detected but  must pass a [Stealth] check to do so. The difficulty of that  check is the Passive Perception of any \u201cseekers\u201d within  range.   Note: The \"passive\" rating of a Skill is half of the Skill's  unscaled \u201cdie max\u201d plus 1. For example, if a character's  [Perception] is level 3, the die for that Skill would be an  eight-sided die (D8). Half of that die's max (8) would be  four (4), giving that character a \"Passive Perception\" of  5.  If the [Stealth] check fails and the \u201cseeker\u201d does not have  line of sight with the \u201csneaker\u201d, the \u201cseeker\u201d will likely  move casually at half-speed to the halfway point of the  sneaker\u2019s Movement to investigate. If the opponent does  have line of sight, the \u201csneaker\u201d has been detected and  the \u201cseeker\u201d has directly spotted them.
